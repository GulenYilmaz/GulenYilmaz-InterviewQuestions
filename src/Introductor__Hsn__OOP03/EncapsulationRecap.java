	/* What does it mean?
	process of putting or wrapping data (variables) and code(methods) inside an object.
	
	How do we achieve encapsulation in Java?
		*	By using class and object
	
	Encapsulation is known as data hiding
	
	How do achieve data hiding
		We cannot access instance variables and methods without creating instance of the related class
		
	// How can we hide data further
	 * Create private variables 
	 * Create methods known as getters and setters
	 *

	/*
	 * All the classes in a framework are an example of 
	 * Encapsulation. In POM classes, we declare the data members using @FindBy and initialization 
	 * of data members 
	 * will be done using Constructor to utilize those in methods.
Encapsulation is a mechanism of binding code and data together in a single unit.
 Encapsulation is binding the data with its related functionalities. Here functionalities mean "methods" 
 and data means "variables"
So we keep variable and methods in one place. 
That place is "class." Class is the base for encapsulation.
With Java Encapsulation, you can hide (restrict access)
 to critical data members in your code, which improves security
As we discussed earlier, if a data member is declared "private", then it can only be accessed
 within the same class. No outside class can access data member (variable) of other class.
However, if you need to access these variables, you have to use public "getter" and "setter" methods.
