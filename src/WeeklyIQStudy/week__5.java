Stack
very fast access
don't have to explicitly de-allocate variables
space is managed efficiently by CPU, memory will not become fragmented
local variables only
limit on stack size (OS-dependent)
variables cannot be resized

Heap
variables can be accessed globally
no limit on memory size
(relatively) slower access
no guaranteed efficient use of space, memory may become fragmented over time as blocks of memory are allocated, then freed
you must manage memory (you're in charge of allocating and freeing variables)
variables can be resized using
